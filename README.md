# Solutions for [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) in Rust

## Disclaimer

These are exercises that I have completed and made public to provide others with ideas for solving problems or learning something new. While I am not an expert in Rust and these may not be the best solutions, they are intended for educational purposes.

Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. It’s a great choice for developers looking to build reliable and efficient software.

Please do not copy the code. The purpose of this material is to facilitate learning; copying the code defeats this purpose and inhibits your own growth and development.

If you’re interested in learning more about Rust, you can check out [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) or [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/).
